/**
 * This is almost like a fuzz test: in each method it runs many iterations of the same operations,
 * but each iteration injects a failure after a different number of writes.
 *
 * Because the behavior or the file system is different on each run, the test is lenient in what it
 * expects from the cache: it accepts a wide variety of download counts. But regardless of whether
 * the file system accepts writes, the cache should never return invalid results.
